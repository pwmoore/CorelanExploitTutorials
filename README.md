# CorelanExploitTutorials

My exploits (in Python) for the [Corelan](https://www.corelan.be) exploit writing tutorials. I currently have

* Tutorial 1 - [Stack Overflows](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/)
* Tutorial 2 - [Jumping to Shellcode](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/23/writing-buffer-overflow-exploits-a-quick-and-basic-tutorial-part-2/) (in progress)

More to come as I add them.
